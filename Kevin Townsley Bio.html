    <p>Born in El Paso, TX. I moved to Sandy, UT with my family in 2003 and have been here ever since. I graduated from Jordan High school and immediately started working and taking classes at SLCC in Accounting. Shortly after starting college I was offered a job with Sysco Intermountain and accepted. I have worked there for the last 5 years, working my way up to Profit Management. I enjoy dispersed camping and kayaking with my dog, Georgia.</p>
